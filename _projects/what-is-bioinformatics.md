## Notes:  
This first short screen-cast introduces "Foundations of Bioinformatics" (BGGN-213) and covers some pre-course logistics.

## Action items:
Before class please:

* Checkout the second introductory ScreenCast: <https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_f17/projects/welcome-screencast/>

* Familiarize yourself with our course website: <https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_f17/>

* Fill in our short pre-course questionnaire: <https://goo.gl/forms/MH9ykT2Wjwl1ic2V2>

## Class structure
We aim to structure each 9am - 12pm class with two breaks of 10 or 15 mins each between three main content/activity blocks, for example:

| Time |         | Example content |
| ------ | ---- | ---- |
| 9:00 to 9:10am | Setup | Pre-class review & Questions |
| 9:10 to 9:50am | **Content block 1** | Lecture content 1 |
| 9:50 to 10:00am | Break 1 | Discuss and circulate with students |
| 10:00 to 10:45am | **Content block 2** | Hands-on activity |
| 10:45 to 11:00am | Break 2 | Discuss and circulate with students |
| 11:00 to 11:45am | **Content block 3** | Lecture content 2 / Hands-on activity  |
| 11:45 to 12:00am | Wrap-up | Post-class review & Questions |
