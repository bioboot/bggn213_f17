Weekly homework will consist of online knowledge assessment quizzes together with pre-class reading and video screen-casts. 

Specific grading criteria (assessment rubrics) will be given at the time of assignment. Weekly grades will be posted on TritonEd. Each student is responsible for checking TritonEd to ensure that a grade has been entered for their submissions. Documents submitted by email do not always arrive at their intended destination and late submissions will not be accepted after one week past the original due date. Collectively homework performance will account for 35% of the course grade.
